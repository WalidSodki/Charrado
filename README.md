# Charrado
Charrado was my final assignment during my Java for Android course at Stockholm University. The game is inspired by various charades applications such as Heads Up! The difference with this application is that the guessing player is not in charge of point allocation/passing but rather the other players doing the charades.

There are over 100 different charade words currently in the game and this can very easily be expanded upon in the strings.xml file.


Playing the game:
The person trying to guess the word should not be able to see what is on the screen, instead the people doing the actual charades uses the application. The guessing player can say pass and one of the charades players presses the pass button. If the correct word is guessed the charade players presses the correct button and a new word is generated!

Each game is 60 seconds long and thereâ€™s a high score system (using SharedPreferences) that saves the best score, even when the application is closed from memory.

The song played when the turn is over is Puppy Love (Sting) by Twin Musicom and is part of the YouTube Audio Library licensed under a Creative Commons license.
